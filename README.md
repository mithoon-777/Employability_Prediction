# Employability Prediction  

This project uses a **Machine Learning model** to predict whether an individual is **Employable** or **Less Employable** based on their skills and attributes. It provides an easy-to-use **Gradio interface** for quick assessments.

## Features  
- Accepts ratings (1-5) for multiple employability factors.  
- Uses a **Logistic Regression model** for better accuracy.  
- Provides a **user-friendly Gradio interface**.  
- Easily **deployable on Hugging Face Spaces**.  

## How It Works  
1. Enter ratings **(1-5)** for various attributes such as communication skills, confidence, and mental alertness.  
2. Click **"Submit"** to get your employability prediction.  
3. The result will be displayed as:  
   - **"Employable"** (if you meet the criteria).  
   - **"Less Employable"** (if improvements are needed).

## Deploying on Hugging Face Spaces
1. Create a new Space on Hugging Face Spaces.
2. Select Gradio as the framework.
3. Upload all project files (app.py, requirements.txt, and model files).
4. Start the space, and your Employability Predictor is live!
